        stale-issue-message: |
          This issue is marked as stale because it has not had any activity for 180 days.

          If it's still important for you add a comment saying what it means to you, remove the stale label, and/or add the "important" label :)

          However, if you just leave it like this, I'll close it in 30 days to help keep your issues relevant!

          Thanks!
