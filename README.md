# foodsaving frontend
Frontend for the foodsaving tool using AngularJS 1.5 (component-based style).
Read more about our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-frontend/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md).

The [backend](https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-backend) had quite some progress in the last months and is currently in a stable state. If you find a bug or miss something in the API, please file an issue in the backend repository.

We used the [NG6-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter) kit.


## yunity and foodsaving
The foodsaving tool will be the first release of the yunity platform.
The [FSINT team](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FSINT/) within yunity provides additional resources to build up foodsaving.
At a later point, more features could be added that support the yunity vision and mission, e.g. multi-sharing communities, item pooling, integrated decision making (syscon).

## Current development goals
- user: sign-up with user name, first & last name, email address
- group/community: create a group, add yourself to a group, leave a group, set up name, description, address and position of a group
- store: create a store which belongs to a group, set up name, description, address and position of a store
- pick-ups: create a pick-up date which belongs to a store, set time and max. amount of ppl who can collect food, user can enter themselves for pick-up
- conversations: write messages to one or more people (present in the backend but is not a priority task for frontend) 

We are keeping the features down to a minimum (check out [that meeting's notes](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/2016-09-13+-+Narrowing+down+features)), in order to progressively build up a useful tool.

### Potential users
In future, we want our feature requests to come directly from foodsaving communities, to fulfill their needs and desires.

We don't have testing communities yet: we are in touch with [existing foodsaving networks](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/Existing+initiatives) who have shown interest in testing the tool once it presents sufficient features for them.

# Getting started

## Requirements

- nodejs and npm
- gulp `npm install -g gulp`
- chrome (for testing)

To clone and install

```
git clone
cd foodsaving-frontend
npm install
```

To run the local dev server

```
npm run dev
```

To lint and run the tests

```
npm run lint
npm run test
```

If you want to use an eslint plugin for your editor, please keep in mind that you either have to install all eslint plugins listed in package.json globally or you run `npm install`. Otherwise your eslint plugin may not work.

## Backend

Per default, all requests to `/api` are forwarded to the online backend `fstool.yunity.org/api`.
To use a local backend, create a file `.env` with content like

```
BACKEND=http://localhost:8080/
```
