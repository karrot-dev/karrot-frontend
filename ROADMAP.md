# Karrot Roadmap

## General Direction

Main topics of Karrot are currently generalization, that means making the features on Karrot available for customization beyond just food pick-ups.
We also want to work on governance topics: how to make decision both in groups and about further Karrot development.
We are taking steps to connect more with the existing user community, but also other people via social media (e.g. Mastodon) and academia.

In the next months, we want to continue working on the stuff that we already started before. In the last months, we established a steady work flow that should help us to do things and put the "dreaming" part on a back-burner.

## Current Development (higher priority)

We are working on this either right now or pretty soon in the future. Should be implemented in the next few months.
