# Foodsaving Tool Roadmap

Only major features and improvements will be listed here.

## Current development

We are working on this either right now or pretty soon in the future. Should be implemented in the next few months.

- Feedback for historic pickup dates (e.g. amount of saved food) https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-frontend/issues/159 / https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-backend/issues/253
- Comment field for pickup dates (for duration, distribution point, mode of transportation for pickup ...) https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-frontend/issues/158
- Invite people to the foodsaving tool by e-mail address https://github.com/yunity/foodsaving-frontend/issues/380
