# Karrot Roadmap

## General Direction as of [2021-04-05](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/roadmap-meeting/410/4)

- Refining UX and some user testing
- Finish testing prototype for community governance features. Begin implementation?
- Start some outreach: contact new potential groups, blogs, participate in events, etc.
- Support creation and onboarding of new group types
- Discussion and design on how to break the silo of groups (e.g. public places and other forms of interactions outside of groups on Karrot)
- Technical infrastructure discussion and improvements: composable data and frontend testing

## Current discussion (higher priority)

We want to work on this in mid-term future. We need to think about it more before we can implement it, so active discussion is highly welcome. Feel free to join in!

- [Choice between "wall" or "activities/pickups" as the default page for a place](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/1703)
- [Better handling for much wanted pickups](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/1242)
- [Applicant trial activity](https://community.foodsaving.world/t/applicant-trial-pickup-proposal/575/)
- [Improve notifications for place conversations](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/issues/2342)
