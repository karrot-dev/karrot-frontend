# Group Applications

Karrot groups are closed (with the exception of the "Playground" group which is open to everyone), so you need to apply to join. Group Applications manage this process.

- for all "closed" groups (everything but the Playground and some older inactive groups) users have to apply to join
- the user applying is shown the "questions for applicants" (group setting)
- members of the group can see the list of applications
- a chat is created with the applicant and the rest of the group (or just "editors"?)
- members of the group (or just editors?) can accept or decline the application (on the overview page)
- past applications are hidden on the list by default, but can be expanded
