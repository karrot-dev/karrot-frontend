# Internationalization (i18n)

## Locales

Karrot is available in different languages.
So, instead of adding English text directly to a component's source file, we add a key instead.
This key points to a text in each of the locale files.

All locale files can be found under `src/locales/`.
For example the Spanish locale file is located at `src/locales/locale-es.json`.

Instead of

```html
<ChangePhoto
  ...
  :label="Group logo"
  :hint="Click to upload your group logo!"
  ...
/>
```

we write

```html
<ChangePhoto
  ...
  :label="$t('GROUP.LOGO')"
  :hint="$t('GROUP.SET_LOGO')"
  ...
/>
```

[`$t(...)`](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/api/#vue-injected-methods) is a function provided by [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n) which does all the lookup magic.

### Adding new text to locales

- Add a new key-value pair to `src/locales/locale-en.json`
- As a convention keys are CAPITALIZED.
- Keys can be nested for better structure.
- Do **not** add the key to the other locale-*.json files.
  They will be added automatically by the CI tool after merge to master and translated by [transifex](https://transifex.com).
