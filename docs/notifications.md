# On-site ("bell") notifications

*This page is about notifications displayed within the app. If you are interested in push notifications, you may want to read [this](https://docs.karrot.world/mobile.html) instead.*

On-site notifications are supposed to inform the user about important events, for example when somebody joined their group or they have a activity soon.

Notifications are generated by the backend, either as follow-up events to user actions (user joins a group) or because time passed (activity happens in some hours).

The frontend loads these via API on startup. If there's unseen notifications, it displays the number of unseen notifications.

To add a new notification, have a look at the `notifications` module on the backend. Create a new signal receiver if a notification depends on a model change, or create a huey crontab task if it depends on time. Make sure to prevent duplicated notifications. If you add more entries to the `context` JSON field, make sure to follow the existing pattern. You can add an expiry date, too.

Now the notification needs to get integrated in the frontend. The module is called `notifications`, too. Every notification needs a nice telling text, a route and an icon.
