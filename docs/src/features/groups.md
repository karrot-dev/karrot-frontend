# Groups

Groups are at the heart of Karrot. Each group is independent from the rest and will usually represent an in-person community of people. They normally have their own organisational name and structure.

They are not part of the karrot organisation, they just use karrot. Ideally one of more of the community members participate in our [community forum](https://community.foodsaving.world/), or via [chat.foodsaving.world/channel/karrot-dev](https://chat.foodsaving.world/channel/karrot-dev)/[GitHub](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend)/etc.
