- a place to discuss and resolve issues in the group
- can be created via the button on a members profiles if enough trust has been given
- a multi page wizard before the issue is created to ensure the user understands the process
- has a "target person" that the issue is about
- a chat is created with all members (or just editors?) and the person
- after some time of discussion a score voting process occurs
- the proposals to vote on are fixed by the software
- voting can result in
    - leaving the member in the group
    - removing member from group
    - repeat the process (or add more time?)
