   * NOTE! VueRouter "history" mode DOESN'T works for Cordova builds,

   * If you decide to go with "history" mode, please also open /config/index.js
   * and set "build.publicPath" to something other than an empty string.
   * Example: '/' instead of current ''
   *
   * If switching back to default "hash" mode, don't forget to set the
   * build publicPath back to '' so Cordova builds work again.
   *
   * BREADCRUMBS - Available types:
   *  - currentGroup
   *  - activeStore
   * ...you can define other ones in KBreadcrumb.
