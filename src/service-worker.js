/*
 *  IMPORTANT!!
 *
 *  This file has its own webpack build.
 *
 *  For production it will be built correctly when you do `yarn build`.
 *
 *  For development it will be built ONCE when you run `yarn dev`, after that you have to run it manually.
 *
 *  If you want to actually use it you must have FCM_SENDER_ID environment variable set to a valid value.
 *
 *  See https://docs.karrot.world/mobile.html for a hint ... you'll need to dig around a bit more on
 *  https://console.firebase.google.com/ though to find the sender id.
